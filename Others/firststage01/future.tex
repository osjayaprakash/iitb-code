\chapter{Future work}


In this work, we have studied various ways of mapping between large text and short text through extracting keyword from large text. \textit{â€¢}

In future, we are planning to using the external resources to better understand the relation between the large text and short text. For example, using the \textit{click-through logs} will be helpful.

\section{Short term Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Complete current experiments}
\item{Analysis of outcome}
\item{Improving within current framework and available resources}
\end{enumerate}

\todo { explain above points }

\section{Long term Plan}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{trying to utilize the external resources apart from Article + meta data}
\item{utilizing the click through logs}
\item{utilizing the semantic class from Freebase, or others }
\end{enumerate}

\todo {elaborate above with examples what it will solve}

\subsection{Click-through logs}
