Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Query represents the information need of user, by which retrieval systems are expected to fetch relevant documents from the collection. Traditional information retrieval focuses on the frequency of word appearance, co-occurrence statistics to uncover the relationships among query and documents.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

In the natural text, 
\shape italic
Polysemous
\shape default
 words introduce ambiguity in understanding user query, and documents. Just presence of query word in the documents alone is not enough to decide the relevance of documents. Sense that word conveys should be verified. If we consider the word 
\shape italic
check
\shape default
, It has four meaning viz, 
\shape italic
examining(verb), examination(noun), bank cheque(noun)
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
check in chess
\shape default
. Considering the queries 
\shape italic
amount of check
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
written check
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
check mate viswanathan anand wins
\shape default
, i) first query is closely related to bank cheque because of presence of 
\shape italic
amount
\shape default
 , ii) second query 
\shape italic
check
\shape default
 which can be written is bank check, to infer this we need to semantics what each concept is and its properties. iii) In third query, 
\shape italic
Viswanathan Anand
\shape default
 is related to 
\shape italic
chess
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
check
\shape default
 is related 
\shape italic
chess
\shape default
. All these analysis on query words to find its sense needs explicit semantics about concepts. Even without explicit data search engines do find similar concepts by co-occurrence and other metrics, but they rarely cover representing the semantics. Semantic search is likely to understand the user intent better with avaiability of structured data.

\begin_layout Standard

The aim of this work is to explore various methods related to improving information retrieval utilizing the Semantic Web, ranking the relationships among concepts in the structured data and combining the Semantic Web with full text search.

Roadmap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The remaining part of this report organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the semantic web. Section 3 explains similarity measurements between concepts from ontology and using the similarity measures in the ranking system. Section 4 describes essence of integrated semantic full text search and Broccoli system. Section 5 is about ranking methods for ranking relationships between two concepts.
