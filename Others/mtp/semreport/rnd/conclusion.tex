\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The problem of summarizing a text document is difficult and well studied. In this work, we have discussed and experimented with different coverage and diversity measures for sub-modular functions.

\subsection{Features}

Similarity methods for measuring representatives of summary sentences for a given text document can further utilize, 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item concepts in the sentences
	\item co-references
	\item other semantic similarities 
\end{enumerate}
