Conclusion and Future work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The standardization of Semantic Web and its tools by the word wide web consortium, lead to automated extraction of facts from semi-structured sources seem to be slowly breaking the chicken and egg problem of generating the semantic data and utilizing the semantic web for various purposes like

Word Sense Disambiguation, Parsing, IE, etc
\shape default
. Still semantic search seems to be fuzzy due its complex nature to Information Retrieval.

In this work we have described the limitations of traditional information retrieval, studied the various similarity measures between two concepts, using the similarity measures in informational retrieval. Further we discussed about limitations of full text search, ontology search and essence of combining them together. Finally we presented various methods for ranking relationships between two concepts.

\begin_layout Standard

Current works on measuring similarity between concepts are based on the structure of semantic web using the path length and information content, not the explicit semantics conveyed through the relationships. Though logical inference is much complex, it will be a good work even if we do it on domain specific area beyond using structural and information content represented in Ontology.
